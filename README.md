# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
An obstacle avoiding robot is an autonomous system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects in its path. When an obstacle is detected within a safe distance, the robot stops, scans left and right using a servo motor, and moves toward the free direction to avoid collision.
